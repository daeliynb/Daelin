## this Code picks a set amount of people from a list inputted below 
## Orginally used for a class, so instead of people, it's students

#lets the user know at the beginning how many students there are

        print("No students left")

        #idx is the number the loop is on
        #the start is 1 so the count doesn't start at 0, typical python rules
        #enumerate pairs the selected students with a number to make a legible list
        #also creates the variable 'name'
